"""
This is a copy of the jsonrpc cgihandler.py, but modified so that it uses strings
in function calls/returns instead of reading/writing to stdin and stdout. This is
so that I can get/put the input/output wherever I want.

The aim is to have a mini-server running that listens on a Unix socket and then
replies on a Unix socket. The actual CGI script will pass the request on to this
socket. This is so that I can run a program that has a persistent state. The CGI
script will be run in a new process for every request, and so can't have persistent
state.
